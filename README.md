# Digital Learning for Data-Science
This repository contains an educational material for a Data-Science Concept called Classification using
Iris Extended Dataset.

## This project is entirely created on Jupyter-Notebook.
The project is entirely created and uses various python Libraries to support our work.

# Content
A general Introduction to Classification.

Working Idea behind Classification.

Some Common Classification Algorithm.

Working with Iris Data and applying  RandomForestClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifer and evaluating Classifiers using evaluation metrics.

# Note
We need to import all the necessary libraries for this process.

Pandas: For working with Iris DataFrame.

Sklearn: For Machine Learning task(Splitting data into test-train and applying classifier like Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier)

Seaborn: For Visualization.
